# ðŸ”— Networking Fundamentals for Containers, Kubernetes & OpenShift on Ubuntu

This guide is designed for beginners who want to truly understand **how IP addressing and networking work** behind the scenes when deploying applications using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **OpenShift**, specifically on **Ubuntu VMs**.

---

## ðŸ”— 1. IP Addressing Basics on Ubuntu

### ðŸ”— Check Your IP Address:

```bash
ip addr show
# OR
hostname -I
```

This will show your network interface and assigned IP address (for example, `192.168.122.101`).

### ðŸ”— Common Ubuntu Networking Tools

* `ip`: modern command to check and manipulate routes and addresses
* `netstat`: view ports in use
* `ss`: see which processes are using which sockets
* `ping`, `curl`, `wget`: useful for testing connectivity

---

## ðŸ”— 2. Docker Networking on Ubuntu

When you install Docker on Ubuntu, it automatically creates a **bridge network** called `docker0`.

### ðŸ”— Docker Networking Overview:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Docker containers typically get an internal IP in the `172.17.0.0/16` range by default.

### ðŸ”— Diagram: Docker Default Bridge Network

```
  +---------------------------+
  |       Ubuntu Host        |
  |  IP: 192.168.122.101     |
  | +---------------------+  |
  | |     docker0:        |  |
  | |   172.17.0.1/16     |  |
  | +---------+-----------+  |
  |           |              |
  |     +-----v-----+        |
  |     | Container |        |
  |     | 172.17.0.2|        |
  |     +-----------+        |
  +---------------------------+
```

To run a container and expose a port:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

You can now access the app at `http://<your-vm-ip>:8080`

---

## ðŸ”— 3. Kubernetes Networking on Ubuntu (via Minikube or kubeadm)

Kubernetes assigns **each Pod its own IP address** (from an internal range). It uses a **Container Network Interface (CNI)** plugin to handle IP addressing.

### ðŸ”— Diagram: Kubernetes Pod Networking

```
+---------------------------+
|     Ubuntu VM Host       |
|  IP: 192.168.122.101     |
|   +-------------------+  |
|   | kubelet & CNI     |  |
|   +----+----------+---+  |
|        |          |      |
|  +-----v--+   +---v----+ |
|  |  Pod1  |   |  Pod2  | |
|  |10.244.0.2|  |10.244.0.3| |
|  +--------+   +--------+ |
+---------------------------+
```

### ðŸ”— Useful Commands

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide  # Shows pod IPs
kubectl get svc           # Shows services and their IPs
```

### ðŸ”— Service Exposure

To make your app accessible from outside the cluster:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=NodePort --port=80
```

Then access: `http://<vm-ip>:<node-port>`

---

## ðŸ”— 4. OpenShift Networking (Overview)

OpenShift builds on Kubernetes and adds secure routes, internal DNS, and Service Mesh.

### ðŸ”— OpenShift App Routing Diagram

```
User (Browser)
     |
     v
Ingress / Route (HTTPS)
     |
     v
Service (ClusterIP)
     |
     v
Pod (App Container)
```

Use `oc get route` to find public-facing URLs for your services.

## ðŸ”— 5. Example App Deployment Flow on Ubuntu

1. **Create Ubuntu VM** (on VirtualBox/Cloud)
2. **Install Docker/Kubernetes/OpenShift CLI**
3. **Pull or build container**:

```bash
docker build -t mywebapp .
```

4. **Run or deploy** the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 mywebapp
```

Or on Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

5. **Expose and Access** via IP:

```bash
curl http://<vm-ip>:8080  # or nodePort IP
```

---

## ðŸ”— Summary

Understanding how containers, pods, and services communicate using IP addresses is **essential** for any beginner working on Ubuntu. Whether itâ€™s Dockerâ€™s bridge, Kubernetes CNI, or OpenShiftâ€™s Route modelâ€”everything starts with understanding the network path.
